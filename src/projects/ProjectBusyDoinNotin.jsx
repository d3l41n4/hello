      <p className="project-description">I want to capture an essence of time. Starting points were different
Tactics of inaction through passive behavior such as drifting, doing nothing, remaining silent or forgetting.
All basic shots were captured using photography and real-time footage
recorded. I have time in both 3D and 2D space with a variety of
Time shifting techniques stretched, from working with the camera to
to intensive post-production. The idea of ​​“time dilation” is also reflected in the
Melodies again: long-lasting tones that freeze moments of the past
seem to evoke.
The choice of virtual reality for the project lies in its immersive nature
Mediums that put the viewer in as relaxed a mood as possible
Should allow immersion in the surroundings. I've had a lot of high speed driving lately
on the train and I love watching the lanterns,
who appear to be dancing around in front of the window. The lanterns
outside the window are static, but they shine on
reason for our movement to fly past us.
I was wondering if we were during our usual
Time experience can be deceived by a similar process
could? How to make the transition from our normal
Experience of time to an extensive past as
show physical structure?</p>
