      <h1>ONE IN A MILLION DAISES (2024)</h1>
      <img src={daises} alt="Koala" />
      <p className="project-description"> One in a million daises is a speculative artefact that 
      blends the softness of textiles with the intricacies of creative coding to archieve 
      and represent the diverse perspectives, expectations and emotions that people make on 
      online dating platforms.
       </p>
      <p className="project-description"> The digital landscape 
       presents a fascinating realm of user-generated content that - by stitching together hearts and hashtags -
       offers valuable insights into #onlinedatingstories and #smashedexpectations 
       of human affection. As human interactions of flirting and showing 
       affection have long become usual on the internet, our quest for intimacy often finds itself 
       immersed in the algorithms of online dating platforms. These algorithms, fuelled by data and code, 
       sift through vast oceans of profiles, seeking patterns, commonalities, and compatibilities of 
       absence and presence. 0s and 1s attempting to calculate our desires, map our preferences, and 
       predict our destinies. In doing so, they become the unseen weavers of our romantic narratives, 
       attempting to stitch hearts together in a virtual embrace.</p>

      <p className="project-description">Within the world of online dating, following rule 1: 
       be attractive - rule 2: don’t be unattractive, we are presented with an illusion of infinite choice.
       The swipes and clicks offer a plethora of potential partners, each promising a unique connection.
       However, this abundance of choice can paradoxically lead to an impoverishment of genuine intimacy.
       The act of swiping becomes a numbing ritual: a process of evaluating and discarding faces with a 
       casual flick of the finger. Just as picking petals off a flower, the couplet “He/she loves me, 
       he/she loves me not” (in French, effeuiller la marguerite) is repeated until the all of the petals 
       are discarded and the line spoken when the final petal is plucked divines the truer statement. The nostalgic image of a 
       field of blooming flowers, where picking petals off a daisy symbolizes the uncertainty and 
       capriciousness of human affection. In a similar fashion, the digital realm of online dating offers
       us the illusion of infinite choice over our romantic destinies, yet it often leaves us questioning
       the authenticity of the connections we forge in this algorithmic garden.</p>
       <p className="project-description"> . To integrate software as a computational
         medium and soft wear as a textile-based interface and bridge the digital and tactile dimensions 
         of human connection. In the role of an evolving visual representation, this interdisciplinary 
         approach fosters a profound exploration, one that carefully weaves together the interplay between
         the virtual and the physical tapestry of life.</p>
