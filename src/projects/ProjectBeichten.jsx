      <h1>BEICHSTUHL (2019)</h1>
      <p className="project-description">Beichstuhl is a performance that took place in the temporary all-gender-toilette
        of the ground floor at Merz Akademie in Stuttgart. I locked myself for three hours
        in one of two toilette cabinets and situationally asked if there is anything 
        the person on the other toilete wants to get off its chest? Starting point for the situational, 
        action-focused and ephemeral artistic performance was the notion of a confessional room 
        in religious spaces and how does physical anonymity contribute to a confension?
        And that being the case, how can an enviroment outside the religious walls
        evoques emotions of surrender and trust? Does a public toilette present an oportunity
        to express concerns and emotional distress when talking to unseen straingers?
