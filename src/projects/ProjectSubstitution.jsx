      Substitution is a research experiment that explores spatial media practices in form of
      physical realisations by placing a biclycle in the center of play. Active engagment is the requirment
      for iluminating fluroscentic plexiglas frames placed in a greenbox.

       The installation raises questions about the production and reproduction of visual
       artistic practices, about the realities and fictions of working, being active and 
       acting professionally and semi-professionally: physical or mental work, social, creative, 
        executive activity, crafts, self-determined work. How we relate to physical and mental labor and 
        this increaslingly blurred space in which the two work in partnership.

      Moving amidst a wealth of material and physical forms of organization by keeping everything in motion,
      perceiving everything and leaving nothing behind,
      according to the motto: allow everything, always live in overly complex tension, always ready 
      for be collections, withdrawals, shifts and conversions. The expanded perception and the 
      reduction of the filters force constant reformulation, elaboration and articulation of the 
      framed fragments of the perceptual process and at the same time keep all objects of perception 
      in a state of possibility, on the edge of realization, in a preliminary phase of overabundance -
      the concern that the economic system set up could become a bottomless pit.
